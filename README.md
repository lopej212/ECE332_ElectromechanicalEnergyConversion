# ECE332 Electromechanical Energy Conversion Laboratory
This repository conatains all of the design and compiled files during my lab for ECE 331 Electromechanial Energy Conversion course.
The design was done on Matlab Simulink and compiled for dSpace, an engineering tool to test mechatronic control systems. 

## General Folder Structure 
Each lab has the design file in Simulink Model file with extension .slx and compile .sdf file. The dSpace project, actual implementation,
is found in the *_rti1104 folder. This folder is holds all the necessary files used by dSpace to control the motors. 

## Typical Experimental Setup of Motor and Controller Board
